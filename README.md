## üìä Project Overview

**AtliQ Hardware**, a rapidly growing Electronics Company (selling PCs, Keyboards, etc.), needed transition from a heavy Excel dependency to a dynamic Business Intelligence (BI) tool like Power BI to analyse their data more effectively.

This shift was crucial as their reliance on Excel was leading to significant financial losses, limiting insights and slowing data-driven decisions.

The **Business Insights 360** Dashboard is built to transform complex data into actionable insights. This dashboard allows stakeholders to seamlessly access and interpret data in an interactive format, covering essential domains that drive business growth.
